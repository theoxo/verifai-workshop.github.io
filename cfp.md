# Call for Papers
In VerifAI-2: The Second Workshop on AI Verification in the Wild we invite papers and discussions that explore the intersection of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the correctness-focused p[...]  

- **Generative AI for formal methods**: Formal methods offer strong guarantees of desired or undesired properties, but they can be challenging to implement and scale. When faced with non-halting proof[...]  

- **Formal methods for generative AI**: Generative AI can benefit from formal methods, which provide assurance and thus build trust. For example, satisfiability solvers can be used as a bottleneck in [...]  

- **AI as verifiers**: Hard guarantees can be notoriously rigid and difficult to achieve or specify, especially in learning-based systems. In these cases, probabilistic methods and learning-based veri[...]  

- **Datasets and benchmarks**: The advancement of research at the intersection of generative AI, verification, and interactive environments relies heavily on the availability of robust datasets and be[...]  

- **Special Theme: Verifiable tasks and environments for reinforcement learning**: Recent progress in large-scale post-training has highlighted the importance of reinforcement learning with verifiable[...]  

- **Tiny and short papers**: We have a separate track for tiny papers. The goal is to encourage submissions of budding findings that are modest but interesting, have not yet have had the resources to [...]  


We welcome novel methodologies, analytic contributions, works in progress, negative results, and positional papers that will foster discussion.  

### Important Dates

**Paper submission opens:** January 5, 2026 <br>
**Deadline for paper submission**: ~~February 5, 2026~~ February 8, 2026 (AoE) <br>
**Notification:** March 1, 2026 <br>

### Submission Requirements

Submissions to VerifAI are limited to 8 pages of content for regular submissions, and 4 pages of content for tiny papers.

**Tiny papers**: Since 2025, ICLR has discontinued the separate "Tiny Papers" track, and is instead requiring each workshop to accept short (3–5 pages in ICLR format, exact page length to be det[...]  

Outside of the content page limit, submissions may also contain an unlimited number of pages for references and appendices. These may not necessarily be read by the reviewers. We request and recommend[...]  

All submissions must be formatted with LaTeX using the [ICLR paper format](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2026.zip).  

All accepted papers will be presented in an in-person poster session, and some will be selected for oral presentation. We also permit papers that have been recently published or are under submission t[...]  

All submissions must be made through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc%252F2026%252FWorkshop%252FVerifAI-2).
